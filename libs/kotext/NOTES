Notes on KoText, ODF and Flake

== Embedded objects ==

* Flake offers already the possibility to embed shapes within shapes. Is this used?

* QTextDocument has a QTextObject class and a virtual createObject that can be used to embed
any type of object inside a QTextDocument. Examples a QTextBlock and QTextFrame (QTextTable is 
derived fro, QTextFrame)

* KoText has KoInlineObject: for these objects, a unicode marker associated with a certain format
is embedded in the QTextDocument. This char format has object type QTextFormat::UserObject + 1 and a certain id. The inline objects are also stored tracked by the KoInlineObjectManager.

* KWord has frames. Frames can contain shapes. See KoTextFrameLoader. Is this another way to anchor an inline shape inside a text shape?

== Pagination ==

* No idea yet how pagination is done.
