Krita is a free and open source digital painting application. It is a raster graphics editor that runs on Linux, Android, Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS. It features an OpenGL-accelerated canvas, an advanced brush engine, color management support, vector artwork support, group-based layer management, non-destructive layers and masks, and switchable customisation profiles. It is for artists who want to create professional work from start to end. Krita is used by comic book artists, illustrators, concept artists, matte and texture painters, and in the digital VFX industry.
