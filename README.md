#### Developers builds

##### Linux build with debug symbols in Qt and Krita

1) Go to Jobs section of Krita's CI: https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita/-/jobs
2) Search for the latest `linux-debug-weekly` job
3) Enter the job and click on Artifacts->Browse
4) Download the AppImage

##### Linux build with ASAN in Qt and Krita

1) Go to Jobs section of Krita's CI: https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita/-/jobs
2) Search for the latest `linux-asan-weekly` job
3) Enter the job and click on Artifacts->Browse
4) Download the AppImage
5) Set up environment variable for ASAN:
    ```bash
        export ASAN_OPTIONS=new_delete_type_mismatch=0:detect_leaks=0
    ```
6) Run the AppImage in the modified environment

##### Windows build with ASAN in Qt and Krita

1) Go to Jobs section of Krita's CI: https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita/-/jobs
2) Search for the latest `windows-asan-weekly` job
3) Enter the job and click on Artifacts->Browse
4) Download the .zip file
5) Open terminal
6) Set up environment variable for ASAN:
    ```
        set ASAN_OPTIONS=new_delete_type_mismatch=0:detect_leaks=0
    ```
7) Change working directory to `c:\path\where\you\downloaded\krita-5.3.0-prealpha-git12345\bin`.
   That is important, otherwise ASAN will not be able to locate llvm-symbolizer.exe and the
   backtraces generated by ASAN will not contain proper symbols.
    ```
        cd c:\path\where\you\downloaded\krita-5.3.0-prealpha-git12345\bin
    ```
8) Run krita
    ```
        krita.com
    ```
