* Strokes queue
** Strokes, jobs... What it is all about? (theory)
*** Structure of a stroke
    An abstraction of a /stroke/ represents a complete action
    performed by a user. This action can be canceled when it has not
    been finished yet, or can be undone after it's undo data has been
    added to the undo stack. Every stroke consists of a set of /stroke
    jobs/. Every job sits in a queue and does a part of work that the
    stroke as a whole must perform on an image. A stroke job cannot be
    canceled while execution and you cannot undo a single job of the
    stroke without canceling the whole stroke.

    *Example:* Lets look at how the Freehand Tool works. Every time the
    user paints a single line on a canvas it creates a /stroke/. This
    stroke consists of several /stroke jobs/: one job initializes
    indirect painting device and starts a transaction, several jobs
    paint dabs of a canvas and the last job merges indirect painting
    device into the canvas and commit the undo information.

    The jobs of the stroke can demand special order of their
    execution. That is the way how they will be executed on a
    multi-core machine. Every job can be either of the type:
    - =CONCURRENT= :: /concurrent/ job may be executed in parallel with
                      any other concurrent job of the stroke as well as
                      with any update job executed by the scheduler

                      *Example:* in Scale Image action each job scales
                      its own layer. All the jobs are executed in
                      parallel.
    - =SEQUENTIAL= :: if the job is /sequential/, no other job may
                      interleave with this one. It means that when the
                      scheduler encounters a sequential job, it waits
                      until all the other stroke jobs are done, starts
                      the sequential job and will not start any other job
                      until this job is finished. Note that a sequential
                      job can be executed in parallel with update jobs
                      those merge layers and masks.

                      *Example:* All the jobs of the Freehand Tool are
                      sequential because you cannot rearrange the
                      painting of dabs. And more than that, you cannot
                      mix the creation of the transaction with painting
                      of anything on a canvas.
    - =BARRIER= :: /barrier/ jobs are special. They created to allow
                   stroke jobs to synchronize with updates when needed. A
                   barrier job works like a sequential one: it does not
                   allow two stroke jobs to be executed simultaneously,
                   but it has one significant addition. A barrier job
                   will not start its execution until /all/ the updates
                   (those were requested with =setDirty()= calls before)
                   has finished their execution. Such behavior is really
                   useful for the case when you need to perform some
                   action after the changes you requested in previous
                   jobs are done and the projection of the image does now
                   correspond the changes you've just done.

                   *Example:* in Scale Image action the signals of the
                   image like =sigSizeChanged= should be emitted after
                   all the work is done and all the updates are
                   finished. So it runs as a barrier job. See
                   =KisProcessingApplicator= class for details.

    Besides one of the types above a job may be defined as
    =EXCLUSIVE=. Exclusive property makes the job to be executed on the
    scheduler exclusively. It means that there will be no other jobs
    (strokes or updates) executed in parallel to this one.

*** The queue of strokes
    The strokes themselves are stored in a queue and executed one by
    one. This is important to know that any two jobs owned by
    different strokes cannot be executed simultaneously. That is the
    first job of a stroke starts its execution only /after/ the
    last job of the previous stroke has finished.

    The stroke is just a container for jobs. It stores some
    information about the work done, like =id()= and
    =name()=. Alongside storing this information it can affect the
    order of execution of jobs as well. The stroke can be defined
    /exclusive/. The meaning of this resembles the behavior of stroke
    job's exclusive property. /Exclusive stroke/ is a stroke that
    executes its jobs with all the updates blocked. The execution of
    updates will start only after the stroke is finished.

** Implementation (practice)
*** Implementation of a stroke
    #+CAPTION: Overview of stroke classes
    [[./img/strokes_queue_internals.png]]

    Each stroke is represented by a =KisStroke= object. It has all the
    basic manipulating methods like: =addJob()=, =endStroke()= and
    =cancelStroke()=. The behavior of a stroke is defined by a
    /stroke strategy/ (KisStrokeStrategy class). This strategy is
    passed to the KisStroke object during construction and owned by
    the stroke.

    Each stroke job is represented by =KisStrokeJob= object. The queue
    of =KisStrokeJob= objects is stored in every stroke object. This
    very object is used for actual running the job (=KisUpdateJobItem=
    calls =KisStrokeJob::run()= method while running). The behavior of
    the stroke job is defined by a strategy (=KisStrokeStrategy=) and
    a data (=KisStrokeJobData=). Those two objects are passed during
    the construction of the KisStrokeJob object.

    A stroke can have four types of jobs:
    - initialization
    - canceling
    - finishing
    - actual painting (named as 'dab' in the code)

    During construction the stroke asks its strategy to create
    strategies for all the four types of job. Then it uses these
    strategies on creation of jobs on corresponding events:
    initialization, canceling, finishing and when the user calls
    =addJob()= method.

    The strategies define all the properties of strokes and stroke
    jobs we were talking above. The data class is used for passing
    information to the stroke by high-level code.

    *Example:* =FreehandStrokeStrategy::Data= accepts such information
    as: =node=, =painter=, =paintInformation=, =dragDistance=

    Other information that is common to the whole
    stroke like names of the paintOp, compositeOp are passed directly
    to the constructor of the stroke strategy.

*** Execution of strokes by =KisStrokesQueue=
    The key class of the strokes' execution is =KisStrokesQueue=. The
    most important method that is responsible for applying all the
    rules about interleaving of jobs mentioned above is
    =KisStrokesQueue::processOneJob=. This method is called by the
    update scheduler each time a free thread appears. First it gets
    the number of merge and stroke jobs currently executing in the
    updater context. Then it checks all the rules one by one.

*** Canceling and undo information trick
    It was stated above that a stroke can be canceled in each moment
    of time. That happens when a user calls
    =KisStroke::cancelStroke()= method. When it is requested the
    stroke drops all the jobs those are present in its queue and has
    not been started yet. Then it enqueues a special kind of job named
    /cancel job/ that reverts all the work done by the stroke. This is
    used for interactive canceling of tools' strokes.

    Taking into account that the strokes can be reverted, we cannot
    use =QUndoStack= capabilities directly. We should add commands to
    the stack /after/ they have been executed. This resembles the way
    how =KisTransactionData= works: its first redo() method doesn't do
    anything because everything has already been painted on a
    device. Here in strokes this "after-effect-addition" is
    implemented in general way. Strokes work with a special kind of
    undo adapter: =KisPostExecutionUndoAdapter=. This adapter wraps
    the commands in a special wrapper that puts them into the stack
    without calling =redo()= and controls their threaded =undo()= and
    =redo()= operations. See information about
    =KisPostExecutionUndoAdapter= in a separate document.

*** Queues balancing
    So we ended up with a solution where our scheduler has two queues
    that it should spread between limited amount of threads. Of course
    there should be some algorithm that balances the queues. Ideally,
    we should balance them by the total area of image the queue should
    process. But we cannot achieve that currently. So the formula for
    size metrics is quite simple:

    ~updatesMetric = <number of update jobs in the queue>~

    ~strokesMetric = <number of strokes> * <jobs in the first stroke>~

    Balancing formula:

    ~balancingRatio = <updatesMetric> / <strokesMetric>~

*** Starting a stroke
    The main entry point to strokes for the user is =KisStrokesFacade=
    interface. This interfaces provides four methods: =startStroke()=,
    =addJob()=, =endStroke()= and =cancelStroke()=. So every time you
    work with strokes you should work using this interface.

    *Note:* KisImage and KisUpdateScheduler both implement this
    interface, so you can use them as a strokes facade. But please try
    not to store pointers to the whole image. Try store a link to
    interface only, if possible.

    So if you want to start a stroke you should do the following:
    1) Create a stroke strategy

    2) Start a stroke with:

       =KisStrokeId strokeId = strokesFacade->startStroke(myStrategy);=

       *Note:* you'll get a KisStrokeId handle for the stroke you
       created. This handle will be used in all the other methods for
       controlling the stroke. This handle is introduced, because
       several users can access the strokes facade simultaneously, so
       there may be several strokes opened simultaneously. It's
       important to understand that even when several strokes are
       opened simultaneously, only one of them executes on the
       cpu. All the other strokes will be delayed until it is
       finished.

    3) Create a data for your stroke job

    4) Add a job to the execution queue:

       =strokesFacade->addJob(strokeId, myData);=

    5) You may add as many jobs as you wish

    6) End or cancel the stroke:

       =strokesFacade->endStroke(strokeId);=

       or

       =strokesFacade->cancelStroke(strokeId);=


* Strokes public API
** Simplified stroke classes
   As you might noticed the internal strokes API is quite complex. If
   you decide to create your own stroke you need to create at least
   six new classes:
   - stroke strategy class
   - four stroke jobs strategies (init, finish, cancel, dab)
   - data that will be passes to a dab-strategy-based job

   That is not really a good solution for a public API, so we introduced
   an adapter that simplifies all these stuff. The class is called
   =KisSimpleStrokeStrategy=. It allows you to define all the jobs you
   need in a single class.

   #+CAPTION: Simple stroke classes
   [[./img/strokes_simplified_api.png]]

   This class has four virtual methods those you can use as
   callbacks. When you need to use one of them just override it in
   your own class and add activation of the corresponding callback to
   the constructor of your class:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
   class MyOwnStroke : public KisSimpleStrokeStrategy {
       MyOwnStroke() {
           enableJob(KisSimpleStrokeStrategy::JOB_INIT);
           enableJob(KisSimpleStrokeStrategy::JOB_FINISH);
           enableJob(KisSimpleStrokeStrategy::JOB_CANCEL);
           enableJob(KisSimpleStrokeStrategy::JOB_DAB);
       }

       void initStrokeCallback()
       {
       }

       void finishStrokeCallback()
       {
       }

       void cancelStrokeCallback()
       {
       }

       void doStrokeCallback(KisStrokeJobData *data)
       {
           Q_UNUSED(data);
       }
   };
   #+END_SRC

   Internally, =KisSimpleStrokeStrategy= creates all the job
   strategies needed for the lowlevel API. And these internal job
   strategies call the callbacks of the parental class.

   *Important:* Notice that the job data passed to /init/, /finish/ and
   /cancel/ jobs is always null. It means that these jobs will always
   be /sequential/ and /non-exclusive/. That is done intentionally to
   simplify the API. At the same time that is a limitation of the
   API. But currently, this is perfectly enough for us.

** Unit-testing of the strokes
   One of the benefits of using the strokes is that you are able to
   test them separately from the UI using a common infrastructure.
*** =utils::StrokeTester= class
    That is a really simple class that you can use to test your own
    stroke. It test the following aspects of your stroke:
    - canceling of the stroke
    - working with indirect painting activated
    - testing updates of the image projection after your stroke
    - working with a layer that is not connected to any image
    The result of the execution is compared against the reference png
    files those you create manually while writing your test.
*** How to write your own test
    You can check examples in =MoveStrokeTest= and
    =FreehandStrokeTest= tests.

    1) You need to inherit your tester class from
       =utils::StrokeTester=. The constructor of that class accepts
       the name of your stroke (it'll be used for generating
       filenames), size of the image and a filename of the preset for
       the paintOp.

       #+BEGIN_SRC c++
         StrokeTester(const QString &name, const QSize &imageSize,
                      const QString &presetFileName = "autobrush_300px.kpp");
       #+END_SRC

    2) Then you need to override at least two methods:
       #+BEGIN_SRC c++
       KisStrokeStrategy* createStroke(bool indirectPainting,
                                       KisResourcesSnapshotSP resources,
                                       KisPainter *painter,
                                       KisImageWSP image);
       void addPaintingJobs(KisImageWSP image,
                            KisResourcesSnapshotSP resources,
                            KisPainter *painter);
       #+END_SRC
       If you thing you need it you may do some corrections for the
       image and active node in the following method:
       #+BEGIN_SRC c++
       void initImage(KisImageWSP image, KisNodeSP activeNode);
       #+END_SRC
    3) Run your test in a testing slot:
       #+BEGIN_SRC c++
         void MyStrokeTest::testStroke()
         {
             MyTester tester();
             tester.test();
         }
       #+END_SRC
    4) During the first run the test will report you many fails and
       will generate you several files with actual result of the
       test. You need to check these files, then move them into the
       tests' data folder: =tests/data/<your_stroke_name>/=
    5) After you copied the files the tester will compare the actual
       result against these very files. That means it'll catch all the
       changes in the work of your stroke, so you'll be able to catch
       all the regressions automatically.

** Predefined classes for usage as base classes
*** =KisPainterBasedStrokeStrategy=
    This class can be used for the strokes those work with the node
    using a painter (or painters like in =KisToolMultihand=). This
    class accepts resources snapshot (=KisResourcesSnapshot=) and a
    painter (painters). Initialization, finishing and canceling
    callbacks of this class do all the work for dealing with indirect
    painting support, creation of transaction, reverting the stroke on
    canceling. This base class is used for =FreehandStroke= mostly.
*** =KisStrokeStrategyUndoCommandBased=
    It is obvious from the name of the class that it works with undo
    commands. In constructor you define which method of undo command
    should be used undo() or redo(). Afterwards, you just add commands
    to the stroke and they are executed with any the sequentiality
    constraints. This stroke strategy does all the work for adding the
    commands to the undo adapter and for canceling them if needed.
** Example classes
   - =KisPainterBasedStrokeStrategy=
   - =FreehandStrokeStrategy=
   - =KisStrokeStrategyUndoCommandBased=
   - =MoveStrokeStrategy=


* Internals of the freehand tool
  #+CAPTION: Freehand tool classes
   [[./img/freehand_tool_internals.png]]
** Motivation for so many classes
   We need to share the codebase between at least four classes:
   =KisToolFreehand=, =KisToolMultihand=, =KisScratchPad=. All these
   classes paint on a canvas with =KisPainter=, so they share quite
   much common code.
** KisResourcesSnapshot
   After we introduced the strokes, the moments of time when user
   paints with mouse and when the line is actually painted on the
   canvas do not coincide. It means that by the time a thread starts
   actual changing the device, the contents of
   =KoCanvasResourceProvider= might have already changed. So before we
   start a stroke we should create a snapshot of all the resources we
   have and pass this snapshot to the stroke.

   For this purpose we introduced =KisResourcesSnapshot= class. It
   solves two problems at the same time: first it stores all the resources
   we might have and second it encapsulates the algorithm of loading
   these resources into a =KisPainter= object. So this class is really
   easy to use. You just create the snapshot and then just load all
   the resources to the painter when needed.

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
     KisResourcesSnapshotSP resources =
         new KisResourcesSnapshot(image,
                                  undoAdapter,
                                  resourceManager);
     KisPainter painter;
     painter.begin(device, selection);
     resources->setupPainter(&painter);

     // paint something

     painter.end();
   #+END_SRC

   In our implementation this class is usually created by
   =KisToolFreehandHelper= and passed to the
   =KisPainterBasedStrokeStrategy= class. The latter one creates
   painters and initializes them using =setupPainter()=.
** =KisToolFreehand= and =KisScratchPad=
   The freehand tool is split into four classes:
   - =KisToolFreehand= :: highlevel tool class that get the mouse
        events form the Ko-classes and distributes events among
        internal classes.
   - =KisToolPaintingInformationBuilder= :: converts mouse events
        represented by =KoPointerEvent= objects into
        =KisPaintInformation= objects.
   - =KisRecordingAdapter= :: stays in charge of adding recording
        information into the image's action recorder. This class has
        two purposes: first we need to be able to disable recording
        for the scratch pad (then we just pass NULL instead of a
        recording adapter), second when the strokes are able to do
        their own recording, it'll be easier to port the freehand tool
        to it.
   - =KisToolFreehandHelper= :: this is the main class that combines
        all the classes we were talking above. It accepts a mouse
        event, converts it using a painting information builder into
        the paint information, notifies recording adapter, takes the
        snapshot of resources and finally starts a stroke. Then it
        populates the stroke with stroke jobs, when the user moves the
        mouse (=paint(event)= method) and finishes the stroke in the
        end.

   Such splitting allows us to use the same classes in both
   =KisToolFreehand= and =KisScratchPad=. The only difference between
   them is that the scratch pad doesn't have a recording adapter at
   all, and uses base class =KisPaintingInformationBuilder= instead of
   =KisToolPaintingInformationBuilder=. The latter differs from the
   former one in a way that it supports painting assistants
   (=adjustDocumentPoint()= method), complex coordinate
   transformations with =KisCoordinatesConverter= (=documentToImage()=
   method) and perspective painting (=calculatePerspective()=
   method). The rest of the code is shared.
** =KisToolMultihand=
   Multihand tool uses the same classes. The only difference, it has a
   couple of modifications in its helper (=KisToolMultihandHelper=),
   those allow it to have several painters at the same time. The
   tool's class inherits the freehand tool's class and just
   substitutes the helper with its own (with =resetHelper()= method).




* Scheduled Undo/Redo
** Two ways of working with undo commands
   The key problem of designing the undo system for strokes was that
   there are two ways of working with undo commands. That is we have
   two types of commands actually:
   - /Qt-like command/ - command's redo() method is executed while the
     command is added into the undo stack
   - /Transaction-like command/ - the command is added to the stack
     /after/ its action has already been performed. It means that the
     first redo() of this command (the one that is called by undo
     stack) does nothing. That is a transaction-like command just
     saves undo data for the future and does not perform anything on
     addition.

   You already know that our strokes can be reverted on the go, it
   means that the stroke's undo command should be added to the undo
   stack only /after/ all the actions of the stroke have been
   performed. So it looks like the stroke's commands are
   /transaction-like/.

   But there is another problem: the stroke should be able to execute
   regular undo commands those are not transaction-like (like is it
   done in =KisStrokeStrategyUndoCommand=). More than that, undo and
   redo of for such strokes should be performed with the same
   sequentiality properties (read "undo/redo operations should be
   threaded as well").

   It follows that the undo commands generated by the stroke should be
   wrapped in a special /wrapper command/, lets call it
   =KisSavedCommand=, that hold the following properties:
   - the wrapper skips the first redo(). It means the wrapped
     command's redo() method will not be called on its addition to the
     stack. Obviously, it is not needed, because the action has
     already been performed by the stroke itself.
   - when undo stack calls to undo/redo methods of the
     wrapper-command, the command creates a stroke
     (=KisStrokeStrategyUndoCommandBased=) and runs the wrapped
     command in a context of this stroke.
   - a special /macro wrapper command/, lets call is
     =KisSavedMacroCommand=, should be able to save all the commands
     executed by a stroke and undo/redo all of them in the original
     order with original sequentiality properties (concurrent,
     sequential, barrier, exclusive).

   That is exactly what we have: =KisSavedUndoCommand= skips the first
   redo and runs undo()/redo() of an internal command in a separate
   stroke. We have =KisSavedMacroCommand= as well to save the contents
   of the whole stroke.

   #+CAPTION: Scheduled commands
   [[./img/scheduled_undo_redo.png]]

** New Undo Adapters
   Well, it would be quite insane to ask all the users of strokes to
   wrap their commands into wrapper, so we introduced a separate undo
   adapter for strokes: =KisPostExecutionUndoAdapter=. This adapter
   wraps your command and puts it into the undo stack
   automatically. This is the only adapter we can use inside strokes,
   that is why all the strokes accept the pointer to it.

   For the legacy code we still have =KisUndoAdapter=, but now we call
   it "legacy undo adapter". It works as usual: it adds a command to
   undo stack directly, so it gets executed right in the moment of
   addition. But there still is one trick. Stroke's commands come to
   the undo stack asynchronously, so if we try to simply add a command
   to the stack, we can catch a race condition easily. That's why the
   legacy undo adapter must guard itself from strokes with locking the
   strokes system. That is done with a special kind of lock
   =barrierLock()=. This barrier lock differs from a regular lock in a
   way that it ways for all the running /strokes/ are finished, while a
   regular lock waits for all the running /stroke jobs/ are done. That's the
   only difference.

   The same race conditions problem applies to the undo()/redo()
   signals from the UI. The user may request the undo operation while
   the stroke is adding its commands. This will surely lead to a
   crash. We solved this problem in a bit hacky way: we hacked
   =QUndoStack= and made it's undo()/redo() slots virtual. After that
   we overridden the stack with our own, and changed these methods to
   block the strokes while undo()/redo() is happening. We use
   =tryBarrierLock()= there, because it is easier to cancel the undo
   than to wait until all the strokes are finished.

** Undo Adapters and Undo Stores
   Well, we have two types of undo adapters now (not counting
   =KisSurrrogateUndoAdapter=). It's obvious that they should share
   some code. That is why we split the work with the actual undo stack
   into a separate class =KisUndoStore=. So now the undo store defines
   "where to store the undo data", and undo adapter defines "how to
   adapt krita's commands to qt's stack". There are additional types
   of store classes for using in tests and for special purposes.

   #+CAPTION: Undo Adapter vs Undo Store
   [[./img/undo_adapters.png]]


* Processings framework
** Motivation
   In Krita we have many actions which have common structure of
   execution. Take a look at actions like Scale Image, Rotate Image,
   Change Color Space - all of them have common phases:
   1) Lock the image
   2) Do the processing of nodes
   3) Unlock the image
   4) Emit setDirty() calls and update the projection of the nodes
   5) Wait until all the setDirty()'es are finished
   6) Emit image's signals like sigImageSizeChanged

   More than that, you should pay attention to the fact that all these
   actions should support undo/redo operations. And the last two
   phases cannot be implemented as usual qt-commands inside a usual
   macro, because they should always be executed /in the end/ of the
   action (in qt commands are executed in reverse order during undo
   operations, that is not what we want).

   And, btw, it would be really good idea to have multithreading
   support for such actions, because some of them (like Scale Image)
   may be quite slow.

   =KisNodeVisitor= cannot fit all these requirements, because it has
   important design limitations: first, walking through nodes is
   implemented inside the visitor itself and, second, emitting signals
   is put into visitors as well. These two limitations prevent the
   code to be shared between actions. That is why we introduced new
   shiny =KisProcessingVisitor= and a separate framework for them.
** Processing visitors

   #+CAPTION: Processing framework
   [[./img/processings_framework.png]]

   The key class of the processing framework is
   =KisProcessingVisitor=. Its main difference from the old visitor is
   that it is extremely simple. It performs one task only, it
   processes one node. And that is all. It does no locking, performs
   no updates, emits no signals. It just processes (that is, changes
   the content) a single node. You can look at the reference
   implementation of it in =KisCropProcessingVisitor= and
   =KisTransformProcessingVisitor=. The key idea of this framework is
   to keep the processings as simple as possible. So the rest of the
   work is done by external classes, those are shared between all the
   processings.

   We have one such class. Its name is =KisProcessingApplicator=. This
   class performs several tasks:
   - creates a stroke. So all the actions executed with this applicator
     will be undo/redo'able.
   - applies a visitor to a requested node.
   - applies a visitor recursively to a node and all its
     children. Note, that you can choose any sequentiality property
     for the execution of your visitor. It means that the visitors can
     be applied to nodes concurrently in multithreaded way.
   - applies a usual qt-command to the image. Sequentiality properties
     may vary as well.
   - emits setDirty() calls for all the nodes which need it. It is
     done in efficient way, so no nodes are updated twice.
   - emits image signals /after/ all the actions and updates are
     finished.

   Lets look at an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
        void KisImage::resizeImageImpl(const QRect& newRect, bool cropLayers)
        {
            if(newRect == bounds()) return;

            QString actionName = cropLayers ? i18n("Crop Image") : i18n("Resize Image");

        (1) KisImageSignalVector emitSignals;
        (2) emitSignals << SizeChangedSignal << ModifiedSignal;

        (3) KisProcessingApplicator applicator(this, m_d->rootLayer,
                                               KisProcessingApplicator::RECURSIVE,
                                               emitSignals, actionName);

            if(cropLayers || !newRect.topLeft().isNull()) {
        (4)     KisProcessingVisitorSP visitor =
                    new KisCropProcessingVisitor(newRect, cropLayers, true);
        (5)     applicator.applyVisitor(visitor, KisStrokeJobData::CONCURRENT);
            }
        (6) applicator.applyCommand(new KisImageResizeCommand(this, newRect.size()));
        (7) applicator.end();
        }
   #+END_SRC

   In lines (1) and (2) we create a list of signals we should emit
   after the execution of the applicator. This list should be passed
   to the /constructor/ of the applicator (3) (the list is passed to
   the constructor instead of end() function, because we face a
   limitation connected with the internals of the implementation of
   undo for processings, I doubt it can create any troubles). In the
   line (3) we create a recursive applicator. In lines (4) and (5) we
   create a visitor and apply it to nodes recursively in a
   multithreaded way. *Warning:* the visitor is shared between all the
   threads so it should be written in a /thread-safe/ way. In line (6)
   we apply a command sequentially, it means that it'll be executed
   right after /all/ the threads with visitors has finished. Line (7)
   closes the stroke an tells it to perform all the updates and emit
   all the signals.

** Implementation of =KisProcessingApplicator=
   The applicator is based on the "undo command"-based stroke
   (=KisStrokeStrategyUndoCommandBased=). It starts the stroke in the
   constructor and adds undo commands to it on every user request. The
   processings are inernally wrapped into a special command
   (=KisProcessingCommand=). This command has its own undo stack that
   collects the transactions executed by the processing. This can be
   easily achieved with our undo adapters interface. The command just
   defines its own =KisSurrogateUndoAdapter= and passes it to the
   processing. Processing adds its transactions to the fake
   adapter. And later, the command just uses the undo stack to
   undo/redo actions executed by the transaction.

   The applicator defines several internal commands as well:
   =UpdateCommand= and =EmitSignalsCommand=. These commands are added
   to the beginning and to the end of every stroke, so that they can
   be executed in the end of both undo and redo operations. The
   parameter =finalUpdate= controls whether the command is executed
   during its redo() or undo() operation.

** Emission of signals trick
   After actions have been moved to separate threads, problems with
   image signals appeared. When everything was executed in a single
   thread the connection of signals like =sigAboutToAddNode= and
   =sigNodeHasBeenAdded= worked as /Qt::DirectConnection/. So these
   signals were effectively function calls. After we moved the actions
   to a separate thread, all of them became /Qt::QueuedConnection/. I
   guess you know what it means. They simply lost all their sense. So
   we had to start to use /Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection/. But there is
   another problem with it. Some of the (old) code is still executed
   in a context of the UI thread and they emit signals as well. So all
   that code causes deadlocks when using
   =Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection=. That is why we had to introduce
   =KisImageSignalRouter=. This class checks which thread emits the
   signal and emits it either using =Qt::DirectConnection= or
   =Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection=. So no deadlocks are possible.

** Progress reporting
   The fact that a processing visitor does a really simple task
   (processes a single node) that is very easy to report progress
   using progress bars in the layer box. We just need to use progress
   pxoxy of the node we process (=KisNodeProgressProxy=). Our
   processings framework provides even easier way of doing this. You
   just need to instantiate a =ProgressHelper= object and ask it to
   create a =KoUpdater= object for you. And all is done. You can see
   an example in =KisTransformProcessingVisitor= class.

** Testing
   Usage of a common framework makes testing really simple. There is a
   separate unittest in image's tests folder: =KisProcessingsTest=. To
   test a processing you need to write just a couple of
   lines. Everything is done by =BaseProcessingTest= helper
   class. This class will run your processing and compare results
   against reference png files those are stored in data folder. If
   there are some problems found, it'll dump result files to the
   current directory.
