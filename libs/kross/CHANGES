== Kross CHANGES ==

2.0
The whole backend got replaced and is build up on Qt's metatypes now.
This means we are able to throw any QObject/QVariant in and just use
the slots as script-functions and the properties as script-members.
So, we don't need wrappers/bindings any longer (and provided
scripting-interfaces don't need to depend on Kross) on the one hand
and and earn a more cleaner interface on the other. Beside the try
to follow KISS, we should earn much more speed that way cause
everything talks now Qt internal :)
