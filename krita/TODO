Krita is the KOffice image manipulation application.
It does not aim to be a direct competitor to the GIMP,
but to integrate well with the other KOffice applications,
to be easy to use and yet powerfull.

We are curently in a beta developement stage but
work towards a 1.0 release that comes with all basic
image manipulation features.

The following feature list aims to give us an idea of what
we want to have in the 1.0 release:

- color modes: Indexed, Greyscale, RGB and RGBA.
- layers
- channels (RGB, CMYK, HSB, etc...)
- layer masks
- plugin filter API
- plugin tool API
- basic image manipulation (contrast/brightness/saturation etc.)
- scale images
- zooming
- native XML file format
- basic import/export filters (png/jpg/tif/gif)
- basic plugin filters (blur/sharpen etc.)
- basic image transformations (rotate, mirror)
- move tool
- crop tool
- basic text tool
- color picker tool
- fill tool (fill with color or pattern)
- gradient tool
- pen (paint brush or pattern)
- brush (paint brush or pattern)
- airbrush (paint brush or pattern)
- eraser
- blur/sharpen with brush tool 
- fullscreen editing mode
- Rules a la gimp 
- Rotate layouts
- Saves channel information to file
- Undo/Redo
- preview in pixel
- Canvas size should be independent of image size

BUGS

- Selections tools don't scale to zoom factor
- Move tool is broken
- Fill tool is broken since layers don't report their size anymore
- The polygon tools are broken
- Drawing on a image more that 512**2 pixels crashes krita since KisPainter has a static pixmap size of 512**2, see KisPainter ctor
- A few KoPainter integration issues 

- Tile left over show up on image import
- Image import larger than current image will crash if you click somewhere outside the image on the canvas that also contains tiles.

TASKS
-----

- Restore Separate Tiles
- Restore undo command
- Restore load/save (plus use ImageMagick to get xcf and pdp support)
- Brush should not be grayscale
- KisPixelRegion should not inherit from ImageMagick Type

- Change kis_sidebar to use KTabCtrl
- Use KTabCtrl to get document tabs, if not, use KSpread's widget
