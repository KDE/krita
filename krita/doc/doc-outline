This document tries to give a suitable outline for Krita's documentation. It
is based on the Krita manual in SVN (koffice/krita/doc/manual/krita.kwd) as of
2005-07-08, the KDE documentation template, and furthermore contains my own
thoughts about what the documentation for a graphics application such as this
should look like.  Comments, suggestions, ideas etc. are more than welcome.
Especially the real content still needs a lot of polishing.
