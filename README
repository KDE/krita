Building and running
--------------------

KOffice is based on the KDE libraries ( http://www.kde.org ) which are
needed to run KOffice.  Note that you don't have to actually run the
KDE desktop environment in order to use KOffice.  KOffice works fine
on any desktop based on X11, and at this point also on Windows and Mac
OS X, although with some glitches.

You will need kdesupport, kdelibs, kdepimlibs and kdebase/runtime
installed if you want to compile and run KOffice.  For importing some
external file formats or other plugins, you may also need some other
dependencies.  For more details on how to build KOffice from the
sources, see http://wiki.koffice.org/index.php?title=Build_KOffice


Developers
----------

KOffice is created by the KDE team, consisting of Open Source
programmers around the world.  All developers give their time/code to
the community for everyone to benefit.

If you have found a bug or missing feature you can always contact the
developers of KOffice (via http://www.koffice.org) or delve into the
source code yourself.

The parts that are shared between all KOffice applications can be found
in the libs/ subdirectory.  There classes like KoDocument can be found;
these classes are extended in the project directories.

Read the .h files in the respective directories for more info or read
the online API docs which you can find at
http://www.koffice.org/developer/apidocmain.php
