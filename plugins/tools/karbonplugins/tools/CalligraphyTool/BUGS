BUGS:
* freehand drawing tool with curve: sometimes the result disappears (seems to be caused by bezierFit receiving two points in sequence that are the same)
* when painting something at the side it becomes impossible to scroll to all areas of the screen
* when painting while the view is zoomed in very much in, the item may get somewere outside the visible area.
* ctrl+mouse weel zoom don't center correctly
* at times the cpu usage remains very high even without doing anything (shape proprieties seem to be the cause)
* colors used are not those of the global palette (I think)
* a "degenerate" curve doesn't show anything... I mean when you have only two points in the same position -- if it has control points it shows as expected in inkscape, firefox, opera, and openoffice, not in konqueror. When it hasn't control points I would expect it to show, nothing, a circle and a square respectively when using But Cap, Round Cap, and Square Cap. I only tested this for inkscape, which showed this behavior except in the third case, where it didn't show anything.
* In a path without control points sometimes at one side there is still a piece of path when there shouldn't... (maybe a Qt bug if it uses QPainterPath to paint)
* in KoParameterShape there is a repainting error when moving the control points
* when the path generated by the calligraphy tool has a _lot_ of points bezierFit() crashes
* KoPathPoint.cpp:374 Does fuzzycompare with 0.0 work, I don't think so..
