Autoformat feature:
kword and kpresenter have autoformat feature:
-> Simple autocorrection :
	-> Convert first letter of a sentence automatically to uppercase
	-> Convert two uppercasecharacters to one uppercase and one lowercase
	-> Auto format Url => when we write http://www.kde.org it replaces
	by a link variable, we detect a url all word we start by http:// ftp://
	mailto: news:/
	-> Suppress double space
	-> Suppress space at the beginning and the end of paragraph
	-> Automatically do bold and underline formatting => when we write
	*kde* => it replace by <bold>kde</bold> and when we write _kde_
	it replaces by <underline>kde</underline>
	-> Replace 1/2 to 1/2 => replace to fraction charactere it works for 
	1/2, 1/4 3/4
	-> Use auto-numbering for numbered paragraphs, when we start a paragraph
	with a <number>+<space>+<text> and we press enter this paragraph and
	next paragraph is replace by number style.
	-> use list-formatting for bulletted paragraph, when we write "* kde" and 
	press enter style of paragraph is replaced by bullet style. We can
	configurate bullet.
-> Custom Quotes : 
	-> we can replace double quotes and simple quotes by specific
	characters.
-> Advanced autocorrection:
	-> we can define word which will replace by a other word 
	=> for example koffices by koffice, or microsoft by linux
->Exception:
	-> we can define list of exception word:
		=>Do not treat as the end of a sequence 
		==>don't upper case after specific word.
		
		=>there is a autoInclude. Autoformat analyse line and detect
		when we force lower case after a '.'

		=>Accept to uppercase letters :
