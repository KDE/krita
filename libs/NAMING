KOffice libs uses so called CamelCase naming for all files in the libraries.
Example:  KoParagDia.cpp
File extensions are always .cpp and .h
We prefer one class per file.  This is to make the filename match the class, which
obviously does not work if there is more then one class in the file.
When there is a private class that is not used outside the file it's ok to have it
in the same file as another class.

KOffice and Namespaces
======================
KOffice in general does not use namespaces, but uses a prefix for each class.
Application maintainers may have a slightly different rule.

The libs certainly don't use namespaces and (exported) classes in the libs use
the name prefix 'Ko'.
This allows you to see that any class that starts with 'Ko' is from the KOffice libs.
Note that this implies that the naming prefix 'Ko' is restricted to the libs, classes
outside the libs are not allowed to use it.

Futher names are
KW for KWord classes
KoPA for the libs/kopageapp library
KPr for KPresenter
Kis for Krita (from KImage-shop)
