This text provides a very short introduction to the architecture of
the chart shape. At this time it's work in progress.

ChartDocument           This class inherits KoDocument. The chart and
                        the formula are special shapes because they
                        are their own document types, defined in
                        ODF. This also means that they can be saved in
                        a subdirectory or inline inside the XML tree.

kchart_export.h         Defines import and export for exported classes.


Chart classes
-------------

The following classes are central in the loading, rendering and
editing of charts.  Most (all?) of the classes directly represent a
chart entity defined in the ODF standard.

Axis                    data about an axis in the chart
DataSet                 data _about_ a dataset. The actual data
                        is stored in a table.
Legend                  stores information about the legend
PlotArea                the main area where the chart itself is shown
Surface                 wall or floor in a 3D chart
CellRegion              a region in e.g. a spreadsheet where a dataset
                        can fetch its values.


Data classes
------------

KDChartModel            Takes a list of DataSet's and compiles them
                        into a QAbstractItemModel for use with KDChart. 
KDChartConversions      Conversions between odf concepts and KDChart
                        concepts

ChartProxyModel         Factory for DataSets and decoration of a
                        ChartTableModel .
TableSource             FIXME: Something to do with connection to Sheets.
OdfLoadingHelper        Helper for loading data when connected to a
                        spreadsheet. FIXME: find out more.

ChartTableModel         Stores the numeric data if this isn't provided
                        from the outside, e.g. from a spreadsheet.
ChartTableView          A view of a table. Used in the data editor.


Helper classes
--------------

kchart_global           Common definitions of enums and some
                        category functions
CellRegionStringValidator Validates a cell region descriptor string
ChartLayout             Manages the layout of the parts (plot area,
                        legend, titles, etc)
ScreenConversions       Conversions between pt (distance) and px (pixels)
SingleModelHelper       FIXME: No idea what this is
TextLabelDummy          Place holder for text labels (title, etc)



Part II: Functional description

Part II contains high-level descriptions on key structures and
processes.


General Architecture
====================

The chart shape is a rather complex shape that inherits KoShape. It is
also at the same time a KoShapeContainer, i.e. it can contain other
KoShapes. The parts of a chart -- plot area, legend, axes titles,
chart title, subtitle and footer -- are all KoShapes themselves, owned
by the ChartShape class. The geometric relationship between them is
managed by the ChartLayout class. This is especially visible when
resizing the chart, something which sometimes rearranges the chart
drastically if the available area becomes very small.

The chart shape is also special because it publishes a small part of
its internal API to the world. Normally the only external API for a
shape is the generic one defined in KoShape.h. The more detailed API
that is used by the tool(s) is seldom published. However, the chart
shape is designed to be used by applications and controlled
programmatically, e.g. from the spreadsheet. When a user updates the
cell values then the chart also has to be updated. This API is
published in interfaces/KoChartInterface.h. (As a side note, I think
this could be done for more shapes.)

The second thing that makes the chart shape special is that Charts
(and Formulas) are defined as their own document types in the ODF
standard.  This means that a chart can actually be its own standalone
document with the file extension .odc. Everything that has to do with
the chart document is collected into the class ChartDocument.

The actual rendering of the chart parts is done with the KDChart
engine from KDAB. This component is licensed under GPL (used here) and
a commercial license. KDChart can render most chart types in ODF with
the exception of 3D type charts. Surface charts are not handled at
all, and 3D variants of 2D charts (bar, line, etc) are shown with
simple extrusions and not real perspective 3D. 3D only types, like
cylinder, cone, etc are not handled at all. Nevertheless, KDChart is
quite capable and works well in general.


ODF and KDChart
---------------

As described above, there are a number of classes which directly
represent entities in the ODF chart standard. These are Axis, Legend,
PlotArea, Surface, DataSet, and CellRegion. All these classes load and
save their internal data to the ODF xml tree and also manage their
respective counterparts from KDChart, so for instance the Axis class
handles all settings and data of the KDChartAxis classes (different
ones for Cartesian and Circular axes).

Unfortunately there is not a perfect 1-to-1 relationship between the
concepts in ODF charts and KDChart so there is some complexity in the
mapping between them.  See below for more details.


KDChart concepts
================

Objects
-------

KDChart is a library of classes that are used to show a chart and also
offers some interaction with them. All the classes are in the KDChart
namespace but in the description below we shall forego the namespace
prefix in the interest of clarity.

The main class in KDChart is _Chart_. This class manages the rest of
the classes and represents the canvas on which the chart parts are
painted. On this Chart there can be zero or more _Diagrams_, each of
which is what we in daily talk call a 'chart'.  There is one type of
subclass to Diagram for each chart type, e.g. PieDiagram or
BarDiagram. If we want to create new types we can subclass
AbstractDiagram. 

Each diagram is associated with a CoordinatePlane which defines the
scale and transformation between data coordinates and pixel
coordinates. There are 3 types of coordinate planes: Cartesian, Polar
and Radar. One coordinate plane can be shared by several diagrams,
making it possible to e.g. create a combined bar and line chart.

A Chart can hold several CoordinatePlanes and/or Diagrams, making it
possible to create advanced layouts with separate diagrams or diagrams
that overlap. 

An _Axis_ is what connects the coordinate plane with a diagram. The
axis is owned by a diagram but can also be associated with other
diagrams, thereby creating a shared axis.

In addition to diagrams there are other types of visible objects on
the Chart: Legends, Headers, Footers, or custom elements that inherit
KDChart::Area. 

A KDChart::Chart is a QWidget, as are many other KDChart objects. The
Legend is the only object that can be placed outside this widget
according to the documentation.


Styling
-------

Each type of object (Diagram, Axis, etc) in KDChart has a set of
attributes associated with it, much like ODF styles.  These are all
named after the object they describe, e.g. BarAttributes,
RulerAttributes, etc.

The normal way to configure an object is to fetch out the attributes,
change some of them, and put them back into the object.


Data
----

KDChart uses the Qt4 model/view paradigm. A class that inherits
AbstractDiagram is at the same time a QAbstractItemView and takes a
QAbstractItemModel as its data input.

The item models that are given to the diagrams combine the numeric
data in that is presented in the chart with some styling coming from
the datasets, e.g. color, marker, etc.


Mapping ODF concepts to KDChart classes
=======================================

The main KDChart::Chart instance is owned by PlotArea. PlotArea also
holds 2 cartesian coordinate plane, one polar and one radar
plane. Third, it holds a list of Diagrams, one per diagram type that
was ever used(?).

The KDChart::Chart can show headers, footers, axis labels and other
text items. The chart shape does not use this but instead uses
standard text shapes for them. There are several reasons for this:
 - The KDChart items are not interactively editable and styleable
 - They cannot be easily moved around
 - The loading and saving of them would be much more difficult,
   especially if rich text is used.
This means that the Chart inside the plotarea will only contain the
diagrams and axes; all other areas are shown outside the Chart, but
inside the ChartShape.

Each class that represents an ODF type (Axis, Legend, etc) also has
ownership of the corresponding KDChart type. Some exceptions exist
(FIXME: Check this in more detail).

The class ChartProxyModel connects the ODF Datasets and numeric data
with KDChart. It takes the numeric input and rearranges it in the
order that is necessary for each chart type.


Editing
=======

Editing of the chart settings can be done only by the ChartTool. The
chart tool uses the API calls in the different storage classes to
change the values. All manipulations are direct and there is currently
no undo/redo with the exception of setting the chart type. [This needs
to be fixed.]

Changing of the data values can be done through the sheet connection
model that are used by e.g. Calligra Sheets (FIXME: Find out more
details).


Using External Data Sources
===========================

E.g. spreadsheets   FIXME: find out more and write this.
