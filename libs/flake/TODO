For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

== Connectors ==
* Add properties to KoShapeConnector (Private class)
  - line width
  - line style (which does ODF support?
  - start + end arrow shapes
* Add multi-line and curve styled properties to KoShapeConnector
  They should be drawn properly as well. Preferrably using the flake-path classes.
* Add  bool KoShapeConnector::isHit(QPointF docPoint, double radius) const;  method.
  This method should return true if the point lies within radius of any line of the connector.
  Note that all params are in doc-coordinates. (pt)
* Get the KoInteractionTool to detect if the click was on or near a connection in which case it should
  'select' the connection and create a strategy to allows the user to alter the connection.
  For example by altering the points of the multi-line or the vector shape of the connection.
In the plugins/defaultTools/ConnectorTool:
* show a preview-line on screen after clicking the first connection point.
* Allow to insert multi-lines much the same way Kivio did previously.
* Create and use an undo command for inserting the connection and the points.


== More Advanced ==
* Add shadow to a KoShape
  - shadow properties as described by the odf spec are (offsetx, offsety, color, opacity)
    -> maybe have a KoShapeShadow class to hold these
  - painting done in the shape itself. The angle is set in the document space, not in the shape-coordianate system
  - on insert into the rTree (KoShapeManager) extend the boudingrect with shadow (note that KoShapeManager is
    a friend of KoShape).
