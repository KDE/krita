Wet colorspace

R  * Fix drying the wet colorspace
R  * Fix fill in wet


Indexed colorspace

?  * create colorspace (allow the actual indexed colors to be of any cs)


Wet & sticky colorspace

?  * finish (in progress already)
?  * Implement Curtiss et. al. for watercolour (Levien, wet dreams. In progress)


Colorspace core stuff

?  * use the icc profile widget from lprof/digikam wherever a profile is selected
?  * add an input profile combobox to the import image & scan dialogs
?  * add an export profile combobox to the export image/print dialogs
?  * support out-of-gamut warning indications for parts of an image 
      containing unprintable colours
?  * preferences dialog can show non-existent profile for the monitor profile -> confusing
?  * check and double check the cms capabilities: especially the use of profiles
      in the render/convert/edit paths.
B * make sure conversion between each and every colorspace is possible (API change)
P * add something for whitebalance

Painterly core stuff

?  * make required changes in core to do painterly stuff
?  * Sumi-e brush tool
?  * Natural media tools (chalk, ink, oil, watercolour -- fun!)
R  * Substrate architecture


Printing and WYSIWYG

?  * fix image resolution handling (zooming, pixel-for-pixel, 100% == zoomed to dpi/xdpi etc.)
?  * make sure displays with non-square pixels also show images correctly
?  * implement resolution dialogs whereever needed (image creation, rescale, zoom etc)
?  * use the resolution parameter (but the resolution dialog is still only a .ui file and not implemented at all)
?  * make sure the printing is colormanaged (check X-PDF and gutenprint)


New ruler system

?  * make and use koffice-wide ruler (do this in cooperation with flake and kofficelib)
?  * allow snapping to guides.
?  * implement autoguides from kofficelib
?  * use koffice wide modifierkeys standard


New selection system

?  * selections, adj. masks, wetness, height masks (all 8-bit mask ideas)
      as sublayers to paint layers, and make them movable between layers
      and x,y, toggle on/off. Allow more than one mask per layer
?  * add opacity slider to selection painting tools so you can select something 50%.
?  * loading and saving of selections
?  * BUG 121975: selections and group layers.
?  * doing a copy of a selection, but having the wrong layer selected gives 
      me an empty selection (all transparent).  Pressing paste should say so 
      (popup) instead of creating a new useless layer.
?  * add deselect with rmb -- maybe also selectable actions with other tools on rmb?
?  * the selection tools should allow pressing shift to go to 'substract' 
      mode without adjusting the combobox for the current tool.  (a different 
      pointer would be nice as well)
?  * add marching ants representation of the active selection?

Paths

Note: all path functionality should be shared with Karbon and flake. Basically,
only the integration into our rendering stack & the conversion from path to
selection mask should give us work. Query: should path objects be attached to
a paint layer, or form their own layer? The latter should be easier to do.

?  * Add path capability 
?  * Make it possible to stroke paths & filter stroked paths
?  * Make it possible to convert a path into a seletction.

Note: where do we use Emmanuele's path tool? Especially the stroking using Krita's 
colors, brushes etc needs to be kept as a feature. Note also the difference between
having an embedded vector object and an path tool with artistic stroking capabilities.
Especially cool when we can stroke using imitation paint.

History & versioning

?  * create history docker
?  * investigate if per layer history is a good idea


Fileformat and import/export

?  * save & load all annotations in .kra files
?  * save & load more information, like PNG comments, gamma information, etc
?  * fix gimp XCF PSD and import/export (ImageMagick hacking...)
?  * fix imports to import metadata.
?  * Saving 16 bit grayscale to jpeg silently converts to 8 bit grayscale (actually 
     saving to both 8bits and 16bits jpeg with the same build is impossible with libjpeg)
R  * Coordinate & create an OASIS File format spec on the CREATE list


Core

?  * move core/ui class private members to d-pointers
?  * fix KisFilter::colorSpaceIndependence/worksWith overlap
?  * add api & gui to exclude channels from compositing
?  * add a mechanism for cspaces to start long-running filters when a paintdev
      is created -- and a gui to turn that on and off, perhaps something analogous
      to a channels box
?  * make set of filter categories extensible
?  * anti-aliased filling (requires some simple colorspace function to merge 2 Pixels)
?  * load/save configuration of everything user-settable.
?  * long painter operations (e.g., convolution painter) should use the
      progressbar and be cancelable.
?  * the fill painter (and perhaps other paitners, too) should call addDirtyRect, 
      and the floodfill tool should use that rect to blit and notify the image, instead 
      of notifying the complete image.s
P? * A possible cause for the threadpool crashing issue is the fact that we throw QStrings across
     threads, and kDebug in threaded filters. Possible fix: use std::string in KisID and don't kDebug in filters. But that's all a long shot, hence the '?' ;)


General user interface

?  * new palette/docker system, much like now but better implemented with QT4. 
      (actually in kofficelib)
     - tabs in dockers drag-and-droppable (vector of docker windows, create new docker if tab
        dropped outside existing docker window)
     - disable dragging the toolbox from dock position to dock position (see Karbon) if QT4 
        doesn't fix relayout
?  * after hiding and reshowing all palettes, the wrong ones are active
?  * color picker: top combo should be as wide as the whole widget; the widget is a bit too big,
      we should try to make the listview a lot smaller. Maybe just use labels here?
?  * the edit palette dialog two-step should be changed into a single dialog
?  * add end poly entry to the popup menu when the poly tool is active (note:
      make this more generically useful for tools. Great idea by David Herman)
B  * make scaling filter more user friendly by removing the combo and just presenting "fast" 
      and "good"
?  * add a cheatsheet widget that integrates with knewstuff to have tutorials that people
      can download and follow from Krita.
?  * create opacity widget (One that grows more white or transparent (showing those gray blocks) based on the input)
?  * Note Ilmari's remarks on the mailing list

Integration

?  * a krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling and transparency
?  * a krita document embedded in another document prints at the wrong place
?  * embedded KOffice objects don't paint themselves correctly


Transform tool

?  * make a good option widget
?  * implement gui, create cursors and update visitor for shearing


Plugins

C  * finish, polish and document scripting support
R  * document plugin API
?  * create plugin that merges grayscale layers back into one color image.
?  * as many filters as possible :-)
?  * sharpen filter with settable sharpness. Look at digikam's code for this.

Tools

?  * dodge and burn tool (see Dik Takken's email)

Release

R  * develop thorough test plan and exercise it on several installations
     before release


Bugs

? Open an image, add image as new layer, resize layer, undo: undo removes the layer
? The change layer size dialog is not the same as the change image dialog, and should
  therefore be called the scale layer dialog. (Resizing a layer makes no sense)
? open an image, add an adjustment layer to the image (I used the pixelize 
  filter). Click on the original layer in the layer dialog box and paint 
  something. The undo the painting and undo add layer. Krita's toolbox will 
  become greyed out and you can't paint. I think this is already a bug and 
  should be fixed. But next, try to add an adjustment layer again -> Krita 
  crashes.
? zooming in leaves display artefacts (see Bart's mail)

Filters

Do levels similar to lightzone http://www.lightcrafts.com/products/lightzone/.
Ask Alexandre Buisse how it should work, exactly. http://sonic.net/~rat/lightcrafts/
for a Linux demo


Regressions



Painting with filters

? sharpen: works badly, paints circles -- this used to be okay!
? small tiles: makes circles, otherwise effect is fun

Note: make kivio flowchart of what happens when painting with and without filters,
with and without selection, direct or indirect, because I don't follow anymore

File format
