This test suite automates the test cases at 
http://develop.opendocumentfellowship.com/testsuite/.

How to run:
The ODF test suite requires QScript bindings of Qt. 
1. svn co svn://labs.trolltech.com/svn/qtscript/generator
2. Please read the README in the generator package. Once you have done that
   * Create the generator by compiling inside generator/
   * Run the generator. This will create bindings for qt-copy. This will
     take quite a bit of time since Qt 4.4 is massive. Unfortunately, there
     seems to be no way to customize what needs to be generated.
   * Now we have to compile the C++ code generated in the above step.
     We need only only QtCore and QtGui bindings, so modify the qtbindings.pro 
     to read something like
         TEMPLATE = subdirs
         SUBDIRS = qtscript_core \
                   qtscript_gui \
                   qs_eval
    * Compile bindings!

Now compile the test suite here. Since the code relies on the bindings, it
needs to find the location of the bindings generated above. This is done by
setting an environment variable QSCRIPT_PLUGIN_PATH.
    QSCRIPT_PLUGIN_PATH=~/generator/plugins ./TestLoading
